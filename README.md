Problem Statement :
Visually impaired students like Arun face significant barriers in accessing STEM education due to the lack of accessible interpretations for diagrams, graphs, and mathematical visuals. Traditional screen readers fail to convey the structural, spatial, and logical elements inherent in STEM content, leading to exclusion from critical learning moments. There is an urgent need for an assistive solution that can interpret and explain STEM visuals—such as charts, equations, and scientific diagrams—through audio, tactile, or multimodal feedback, enabling equitable learning experiences for visually impaired learners.
